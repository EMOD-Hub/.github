Getting Started with EMOD
==========================
Since EMOD is a stochastic model, you must run numerous realizations of each scenario in order to collect proper statistics.  You will likely need a high performance computing (HPC) platform to run these simulations.  As of July 2024, we only support a SLURM-based HPC.

To make running EMOD easier, we have created some python packages that simplify configuring, running, and plotting the results.  As of July 2024, we are working to make these packages more user friendly and will have updates coming in Q4 of 2024.
