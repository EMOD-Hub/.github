How to Contribute to EMOD
=========================
If you are considering contributing to one of the existing repositories, 
it is recommend that you join our [Slack group](Community.md) and post a 
comment/question in the "help" channel indicating that you want to do this.  
This will allow the community to discuss with you the changes you are
considering, warn you about any up coming changes that might impact your
idea, and tips on how to make the contribution.

Assuming that you have communicated with the community, contributions are
typically made via a Pull Reqest.  This means you need to do the following:
- Fork the repository that you are considering contributing to.
- Clone your fork to your laptop
- Create a new branch from the main branch
- Make your changes and test them
- Commit your changes to your local clone
- Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.com
- Make a Pull Request from your fork to the appropriate repo on EMOD-Hub vs the main branch
- Maybe ping someone on Slack to make sure we know it is ready for review

Please note that we are still in the process of defining the requirements
for contributions, but don't let that stop you.  Start a discussion
today.
